Other two showed adherence to common style of space before/after parentheses,,,,,,,, but didn't give as much personal interjections, and was also overall more focused on a summary of the book than the first. Third review was also very summary-coded, preferring to keep things abstract rather than state concretely what precisely the toy was doing, or at least it appeared that way., but the second review was notably less unique than either the first or the third. I still think that the overall style was more similar between #1 and #2.,, but I am fairly sure that #1 is the odd one out because of a few grammatical irregularities. The parentheses were an example, but the first review also had better control over the use of commas than either the second or the third reviews. To me, that suggests that the first review was different from the second and third. (Second and third used a lot of commas where periods would normally go," while the first excerpt used commas more often to join two independent sentences/in a generally more ""standard"" way.)"
